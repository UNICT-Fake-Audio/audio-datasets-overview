          <p>
            Machine Learning, and in general Artificial Intelligence approaches, brought a great advance in each and every field of Computer
            Science increasing accuracy levels of predictors in any known problem. Indeed, this evolution enabled the construction of
            effective frameworks and solutions able to be used in investigative and forensics scenarios for detection of fakes and, in
            general, manipulations in multimedia contents. On the other hand, can we trust these systems? Is research activity going in the
            right direction? Are we just taking the low-hanging fruit without taking into account many real-case-in-the-wild situations? The
            purpose of this paper is to raise an alert to the research community in the specific context of synthetic voice detection, where
            data available for training is not big enough to give sufficient trust in the techniques available in the literature. To this
            aim, an exploratory investigation of the most common voice spoofing dataset was carried out and it was surprisingly easy to
            build simple classifiers without any Deep Learning techniques. Simple considerations on bitrate were sufficient to achieve an
            effective detection performance.

          <p>
            The detection of synthetic audio has recently gained great attention, as it is a crucial problem in modern technological
            applications which require speech recognition modules. This phenomenon poses a significant threat to society, as it contributes
            to false political propaganda, disinformation, as well as fraud. While the current state-of-the-art techniques typically use
            deep neural networks, it is observed that these methods are complex, hugely data-demanding, and computationally expensive.
            Furthermore, they suffer from overfitting due to dataset orientation, making them ineffective when data are noisy or, in
            general, data come from uncontrolled scenarios. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive benchmarking analysis across multiple
            publicly available datasets highlighting the weaknesses of existing approaches. We suggest a method for detecting synthetic
            audio by analyzing audio features without compromising accuracy under noisy conditions and exploring the use of silence to
            identify fake audio. Ultimately, we introduce a new small dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of synthetic audio detectors in
            unconstrained scenarios showing that few-shot learning paradigms can be used to successfully address this detection problem.
